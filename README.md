# JE-2

• For this project, I wanted to concentrate on something that would be useful for both the class and for my personal website. 
    - At first I had way too much information and unneccesary lines of code in my Resume page, which made things look dirty and cluttered. 
    - This time around, I created a trello board type app where I am able to display the upcoming updates for the entire website or individual pages utilizing the 0.0.0 update format

    -- Along the way, I realized that even I was getting confused with all of the "tasks" and "items" that were being displayed in the updates board page. 
    -- So as any reasonable developer with no time on their hands would do, I decided to pile on more stuff on my plate...
    --This resulted in two positives and one negative: Positive--> Individual "trello" pages are easier to read, sort through and view. Positive--> overall code for both "apps" is organized and can be worked on in a more streamlined manner. Negative--> one of the apps broke and there is no clear answer in sight. 

    This project really taught me new ways to work with code and reinforced the concepts I already new. Since we had a bit more freedom, I explored new CSS styling with animations & Bootstrap. 

        •The second portion of the proejct was a bit tricky. I went for the simpler route in terms of the app, but usefullness is mindboging. However, when it came to linking all EJS files together...It was easier said than done, since I was implementing different CSS sheets, MP# files and MP$ files. 

        The applications I built for this iteration of my website and project #2 are simple yes, but the future functionality that they will create is worth it. 

        My ultimate goal is to create an open source personal website, where people can take a look at my updates along wiuth the potential code changes, bug fixes where people can share their opinions through comments and debug code in a SO / Reddit format. 

        Like buttons were implemented, along with dislike buttons and replies. 

        This effectively takes a load off anyone who is actively working on their personal website. Since the Admin/main-user can get direct feedback from people who visit the Personal Website. 

Finally, I had a showdown with heroku, it was hands down the most difficult part of the build, and the answer was that the file name started with a capital letter... thats how it goes. Shoutout to Brendan for being an absolute gigachad and helping me trouble shoot through it. 

There are many things to be done still, CSS touch ups, potential route fixes, potential CSS changes in general to accomodate for a more proffesional look. 

Ultimately, this website is going to be a compilation of all of my projects, successes, failures, tests, rewrites and everything in between. 

homeworks will be added in a separate seciton, personal test apps will have their own section.

The final strech is to integrate three.js into the website to be able to diplay 3d animations in videogame format. 

We got a lot to do, all of us. So lets keep going.
