# project_3_front

For this project, we wanted to dive into instagram since it is notoriously a postresql platform. 

In out case we wanted to do it with mongodb, and it worked out splendidly. 

A few roadbumps were hit however. We spent too much time in the backend, which led to us being under a bit of a time crunch. Out of a week, we had just over 3 days left to complete a semi-robust front end with react. 

One of the days, my project partner had a bit of a crisis, and stayed up all night creating new components for the frontend. Something we had not planned before and was created without any notice to the other teamates. 

Once we learned about this, we had to read up on what he used, how he used it and what the components where actually doing in the frontend. 

This created a bit of a steep learning curve that was not supposed to be there, BUT, it was and we had to adapt. So I did my best to merge my original components with the new additions. In the end, the project turned out great and we learned a lot from eachother. Overall a positive experience since we were able to push ourselves to learn under presssure and uncertainty.
